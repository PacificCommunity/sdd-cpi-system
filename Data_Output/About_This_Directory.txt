Used to store final R dataframes generated from the system. 

At the end of the running all code, two things happen: 
(A) some "final" output is made, and not used for further processing within this system (although it may be read into other systems by other system code), and 
(B) some "final" output product is made, for example, a shiny website, a word document, a pdf or a whatever.

This is the place to save the final output.
